# WINLFFS
This repository is the Visual Studio solution to my student capstone project. 
It consists of all of the items used in creating my filesystem which is primarily aimed at the transfer of 
large files, greater than 4GB, as some current filesystems are unable to do so. Additionally, the ones that are
are not usually open source, making any modifications difficult if not impossible. For a better explaination, please go
to the [primary repository](https://github.com/bholmes94/didactic-spoon "primary repository"). Any general updates and
explainations are more likely to be found there. More specific information will be found or repeated here.
